## Program Output

### What is the output from running the following commands?

TODO: Use a fenced code block to provide the output for this command.

- `python compute-tuple-intersection.py`

TODO: Use a fenced code block to provide the output for this command.

- `python perform-apply-to-each.py`

## Program Understanding

### TODO: Explain every component of the following function signature

`def compute_intersection(tuple_one: Tuple[Any, ...], tuple_two: Tuple[Any, ...]) -> Tuple[Any, ...]:`

### TODO: Why does the `compute_intersection` function return different outputs depending on its inputs?

### TODO: Explain every component of the following function signature

`def apply_to_each(values: List[int], function: Callable) -> None`

### TODO: Why does the `apply_to_each` function not need to return a list?
